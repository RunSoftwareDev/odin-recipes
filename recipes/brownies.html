    <h2>One-pan brownies</h2>
    <p>Save time on dishes and have a delicious pan of brownies.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 sticks (12 Tablespoons, 3/4 cup) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar </li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
            <li>1 cup sifted cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li>
            <li>Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling (optional)</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8 x 8 inch baking dish with butter. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium sized pot, melt the butter on the stove top over medium heat. 
                Remove from heat, then whisk in brown and white sugar until smooth and creamy, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs and egg yolk, one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla and salt. </li>
            <li>Add the cocoa powder and flour and stir until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract. Stir.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and bake for 33-39 minutes (under done) or 40-45 minutes (baked through), 
                or until the center is just set. A toothpick inserted in the center should come back with a few moist crumbs attached. 
                Sprinkle with sea salt, if desired. </li>
            <li>Allow to cool or eat directly out of the pan because you have no self control (at least, that's what I do.)</li>
        </ol>
