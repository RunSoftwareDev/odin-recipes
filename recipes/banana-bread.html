    <h2>Deliciously moist banana bread</h2>
    <p>This simple banana bread recipe is the BEST way to use overripe bananas. 
        It's incredibly easy and the banana bread is always soft, moist, and delicious.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2-4 ripe bananas</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
            <li>1.5 cups flour</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Prepare a loaf pan with butter, oil, or even Pam spray.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the melted butter and sugar. </li>
            <li>Add the bananas. Mash them then mix into the butter and sugar mixture. </li>
            <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract. Stir.</li>
            <li>Mix in the baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and flour. </li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 40 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. <strong>OVEN TIMES VARY.</strong>  Some people need 55 minutes. 
                Others need 30 minutes. Please use your own judgment and the toothpick trick (insert a wooden toothpick in the middle of the bread. 
                If it comes out clean, the bread is done. If it comes out with batter on the toothpick, please continue baking. It is not done). 
                In a fairly new, convection oven, it takes around 40 minutes for my bread to be done.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and let cool. For clean slices, please allow the bread to completely cool. </li>
        </ol>
